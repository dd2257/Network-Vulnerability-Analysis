# Network-Vulnerability-Analysis
This project involves the identification and analysis of network vulnerabilities using the Nessus vulnerability scanning tool. The key objectives were to identify vulnerabilities in a network environment, understand their implications, and explore mitigation strategies.

Two significant vulnerabilities were identified:

SMB Signing Not Required: This vulnerability exposes the SMB server to potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to the lack of enforced message signing.
SSL Self-Signed Certificate: The use of self-signed SSL certificates instead of those issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) can lead to security risks.
In addition to these specific vulnerabilities, the project also delves into common network scanning vulnerabilities, including unpatched software, weak passwords, open ports, denial of service (DoS), and misconfigured firewalls. Mitigation strategies for each of these vulnerabilities were discussed to enhance network security.

This project provides valuable insights into the importance of regular network vulnerability assessments and the implementation of best practices to safeguard against potential attacks.
